# River Irwell 
I have chosen to investigate 2015's Boxing Day flood of the River Irwell in Greater Manchester, as I live nearby Manchester and I am interested in looking into past and future flood mitigation plans for this area.

## Data collection
Once I had decided which flood to investigate, I contacted the Environment Agency and requested the data from the Adelphi Weir measuring station for the River Irwell, as this is the closest station to the centre of Manchester. I chose this one as I thought it would be interesting to look at how the flooding affects the busiest part of the county and how the Council are planning to lower the risk of damage to infrastructure in the future. The data they provided me with included the height of the river and the flow of the river at 15 minute intervals throughout the period, and the coefficients needed for the rating curve. 

Using this data I was able to plot the followng quadrant graoh, which shows the different relationships between time, flow and river height. I chose the threshold height of flooding *h<sub>T</sub>* by examining local news articles from the flood. A pub nearby to the local station had flooded with 3 feet of water by 3pm on 26th December - I compared this to my data and discovered that the height of the river at this time was 3.592m. Also, looking at Shoothill's GaugeMap, I found out that the recent highest level of the river here was 2.66m, however from knowledge from family and friends I do know no flooding occured at this time. Therefore I took my threshold to be in the middle of these 2 values, at 3m.

## Flood mitigation plans
The Environment Agency also provided me with a small amount of information about flood mitigation plans that have been implemented since the flood of 2015.
