# River Irwell 
As part of my final year project for my Mathematics degree at the University of Leeds, I have completed an analysis of the River Irwell in Greater Manchester, my motivation being the proximity in which I live to this river, and my interest in investigating how a large-scale flood might impact a large city. The River Irwell also flooded on Boxing Day in 2015, so I chose to focus on this flood to see how it compared to the floods already researched by the whole group.

I chose to use the monitoring station at Adelphi Weir, as it is very near to Manchester city centre, so it allowed me to analyse the effects of the flood on the busiest areas of the city.

## Quadrant plot

The Environment Agency provided me with the data I required to carry out this investigation - river height and the rating curve information for the required time period. This data allowed me to plot the following graph, showing the relationships between river height, flow and time of the flood.

*Figure 1: Quadrant plot for the December 2015 flood of the River Irwell at Adelphi Weir monitoring station. A threshold height of 3m was used, indicated by the dotted line. A rating curve and its linear approximation can be seen in the upper left quadrant. Views of the river height and its flow rate across the flood duration T<sub>f</sub> = 10.00hrs can be seen in the lower left and upper right quadrants respectively. An estimation of the FEV was calculated to yield FEV = 6.58Mm<sup>3</sup> and can be represented by the area of the pink shaded region. The black rectangle has an area representative of an estimate FEV = 6.57 Mm<sup>3</sup>.*

My threshold height *h<sub>T</sub>* was chosen by looking at multiple sources. Shoothill's GaugeMap estimates that minor flooding is possible in the surrounding areas at a height of 2m. However, From local knowledge, I know that on this day there was no flooding on the most recent highest height, 2.66m. A news article from the day of the Boxing Day flood states that the Mark Addy pub, near the Adelphi Weir station, was flooded by 3 to 4 feet of water by 3pm. At 3pm, the height of the river was 3.592m (from the information provided by the Environment Agency). Therefore I estimated my threshold height above which flooding occurs as 3m, to ensure that the river has broken its banks by this height.

## Estimating FEV 

The flood excess volume was estimated to be 6.58 Mm<sup>3</sup>.
