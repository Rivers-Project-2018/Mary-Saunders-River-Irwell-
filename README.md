# River Irwell 
I have chosen to investigate 2015's Boxing Day flood of the River Irwell in Greater Manchester, as I live nearby Manchester and I am interested in looking into past and future flood mitigation plans for this area.

## Data collection
Once I had decided which flood to investigate, I contacted the Environment Agency and requested the data from the two measuring stations for the River Irwell closest to the centre of Manchester, Adelphi Weir and Manchester Racecourse, for the period of the flood (25th December 2015 to 30th December 2015, with flooding occuring on 26th December 2015). The data they provided me with included the height of the river and the flow of the river at 15 minute intervals throughout the period.
With this data I will be able to plot a quadrant graph showing how the height and flow of the river changed with time. I am currently awaiting a response from the Environment Agency regarding their 'height of spill' value, in order for me to show on the graph when flooding first began.

## Flood mitigation plans
The Environment Agency also provided me with a small amount of information about flood mitigation plans that have been implemented since the flood of 2015.
